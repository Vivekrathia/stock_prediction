# stock_prediction
ðŸ“ˆ Stock Price Prediction with LSTM ðŸš€ In this project, I had the exciting opportunity to dive into the world of stock market analysis and prediction using the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. Technologies Used for this project, I primarily utilized the following tools and technologies: Python for data preprocessing, manipulation, visualization, and model implementation. Google colab as the coding environment for interactive development. Keras library to build and train the LSTM model.
